### Case Study - Human Acticity Recognition
Mobile phone sensor data (accelerometer and gyroscope) is collected from 30 individuals performing one of six activities: 
{walking, walking-upstairs, walking-downstairs, sitting, standing, lying-down}. 
The goal is to predict the activities performed using 561-length feature vectors for each instance generated by the processed sensor signals. 
We model each individual as a separate task and use a complete graph to model the network topology. 
We use a linear model as the prediction function with cross-entropy-loss.

### Download Dataset
- Human activity recognition (HAR) Dataset can be downloaded here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones
- Download the dataset, unzip it, and put the folder under HumanActivityRecog/

### Instructions
Tested on python 3.7

- Run main.py to reproduce the results shown in the paper.
- In main.py, "rule" can be "no-cooperation", "loss", "distance", " average", as explained in the paper.
- "N" is the total number of agents in the network including the Byzantine agents, "attacker_num" defines the number of attackers.

### Results
Results show that the loss-based weight assignment rule outperforms all the other rules as well as the non-cooperative case, 
with respect to the mean and range of the average loss and accuracy, with and without the presence of Byzantine agents. 
Hence, our simulations imply that the loss-based weights have accurately learned the relationship among agents. 
Moreover, normal agents having a large regret in their estimation indeed benefit from cooperating with other agents having a small regret.
